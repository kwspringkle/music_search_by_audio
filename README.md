# Music search by audio

Install all required packages:
```sh
pip install django
pip install python-dotenv
```

Create a new .env file (same level with manage.py) with content:
```sh
API_KEY=your-api-key
```

API KEY is from AudD.io. You can read the documents and get api key [here]{ https://audd.io/ }

To run the project:
```sh
python manage.py runserver
```

The prototype frontend and recommend function  haven't finished yet, I will improve them in the near future. You can refer to the UI design [here]{ https://www.figma.com/design/h1fH7ZpEF4jJccuMKiU2GD/CocCoc's-Music-Search-Prototype-UI-Design?node-id=0-1&t=UzICBwVg0fZ3ln7F-1 }
